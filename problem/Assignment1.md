Every Sunday Sandeep goes for 50 KM jogging after every kilometre he drinks 1 Litre of water & after every 5 KM he eats 1 banana.
Please answer after finishing jogging how much water Sandeep drank & how many bananas he has eaten.

Also, Sandeep starts with a speed of 10 KM/hr & after eating banana his speed increases by 1 KM/hr so tell how much time it took him to finish his morning activity
